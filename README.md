[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10913) • Project Page(soon)

> **TL;DR.** To address the negation issue in CLIP, we propose data generation pipelines and validate their effectiveness using public and novel benchmarks. Our approach enhances negation awareness and extends to diverse multimodal tasks.

## Status
- ✅ Preprint available on arXiv
- 🚧 Code release in progress (configs & checkpoints coming soon)
